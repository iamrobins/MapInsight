However, the Covent Garden branch seems to consistently underperform compared to the others.\n\nThe food itself is still very good. The sushi platter we ordered was excellent - fresh, flavorful, and beautifully presented. The quality of the ingredients and preparation is on par with what I've experienced at their other restaurants.\n\nHowever, the service is really where this location falls short. The server seemed more focused on socializing with their coworkers than attending to our table. It took a very long time to get our order taken, get refills, and even get the bill. They just didn't seem engaged or interested in providing a good customer experience.\n\nWhile the pricing is consistent across Sticks & Sushi locations, the poor service here just doesn't live up to the standard I expect from this restaurant group. The food is still great, but the lack of attentive service drags down the overall experience.\n\nOverall, I'd rate this particular Sticks & Sushi location a 3 out of 5. The food is still top-notch, but the service issues are hard to overlook. I'll continue visiting their other London locations, but I'd be hesitant to come back to this Covent Garden branch unless I hear the service has improved.",

Outstanding quality of fish, selected from the best in the world of the season (our tuna was from Portugal)\n\nThe experience leave you wanting more and is definitely a contributing factor to our impulse Japan trip booking. Even the post-meal fruit selection was of exceptional quality. We had the best mango one can imagine (and probably 10x better!!!)\n\nIt is pricy but, less pricy than flights to Japan (you also won’t need to take leave or book hotels!) It’s like a little taste of Japan without the effort of long haul flights, truly the best you can get in London. Will for sure visit their original Ginza location soon.",
