However, the Covent Garden branch seems to consistently underperform compared to the others.\n\nThe food itself is still very good. The sushi platter we ordered was excellent - fresh, flavorful, and beautifully presented. The quality of the ingredients and preparation is on par with what I've experienced at their other restaurants.\n\nHowever, the service is really where this location falls short. The server seemed more focused on socializing with their coworkers than attending to our table. It took a very long time to get our order taken, get refills, and even get the bill. They just didn't seem engaged or interested in providing a good customer experience.\n\nWhile the pricing is consistent across Sticks & Sushi locations, the poor service here just doesn't live up to the standard I expect from this restaurant group. The food is still great, but the lack of attentive service drags down the overall experience.\n\nOverall, I'd rate this particular Sticks & Sushi location a 3 out of 5. The food is still top-notch, but the service issues are hard to overlook. I'll continue visiting their other London locations, but I'd be hesitant to come back to this Covent Garden branch unless I hear the service has improved.",

We didn’t book a table and it was very busy, but were lucky, as we didn’t have to wait for a table.\n\nThe food is amazing as always. And the staff are very friendly there. There is also always someone walking around with a jug of water to top up your glass of water 💧.\n\nThey do have lovely cocktails 🍹 there. This dragon 🐉 cocktail that I had was delicious, but since I’m Asian, I’m quite a light weight 😳.\n\nWe didn’t finish our food, so we asked for a takeaway box. The waitress who served us, put all the food in the box and a bag for us.\n\nSome may say the food is pricey there, but for the quality it is totally worth it! I highly recommend Dozo sushi 🍣 if you are in London and fancy sushi for lunch or dinner 😊",

All of the food are excellent quality as always.\n\nThough every visit, the waiters can be quite rude or agreesive. Especially this one particular older woman, she always seems like she is in a bad mood and forced to work there. Never smiled once; I feel like she was never happy to serve anybody, even any other table.\n\nAs I try to be on the best of my behaviour every visit, even bowing and showing my respect; I could hear them speak Cantonese and feel the hostility.\n\nFew of the occasions being:\n\n1 / Booked a table for 3 and was forced to wait 20 minutes after our booking time. This is so that one of the tables could finish. Why bother booking in the first place? Served by the same older lady.\n\n2 / Once having ordered my dish, the wait time was very long. They were busy but it's understandable. However, once everybody else received their food, I didn't get my order - served by the same older lady, who took my order. I waited 10 minutes after and asked her, she responded in a rude tone, saying I had to wait. Anyways, I asked a different waitress 20 minutes later, she was nice but she said she check that for me. Total waiting 40 minutes AFTER all of my friends had finished their food. (Not including wait time in total).\n\nOverall, the service is appalling, they are not doing purposefully but at least have some respect amongst everybody. I did not dare to ask that older lady for the bill. Very rude.\n\nThough that does not stop me from coming to Dozo, I can sacrifice experiencing the service for excellent food.\n\n3-4 stars overall. Easy 5 if they did something about the service, seeing other reviews have the same issue.",

People seemed friendly from the moment we walked in and we were able to put our luggages in a coat room (and gave us a fish with the number to take \'em back before leaving), an amazing courtesy 😃 which not many restaurant and places offer.\n\nThe menù is interesting although a bit confusing but the staff serving us at the table did a very good job in explaining and helping us with the choices, and everyone was available at all times to assist.\n\nThe Perfect Day was our choice! Unfortunately, duck and coriander are not something we could eat so we had to ask to switch for something different and, when the approval/discretion of the chef was given, we were happy to be able to do switch.\n\nDefinitely a very good sushi quality, however it is important to explain why 4 and not 5 stars.\nThe rice could be improved, the tempura prawns were cold and this inside the roll was probably not freshly fried. The tobiko inside the rolls was creamy and not "bubbley", so, I the mouth you could not feel the little eggs when eating \'em. Did not enjoy the consistency.\n\nAlso, the place was not easy to find as the outdoor sign is not very "catchy" but it is located very close to London Victoria Station and only 3 mins from the Bus (211, 11, 170) Stop to go to Victoria Coach Station.\n\nNice though, I loved it!

Outstanding quality of fish, selected from the best in the world of the season (our tuna was from Portugal)\n\nThe experience leave you wanting more and is definitely a contributing factor to our impulse Japan trip booking. Even the post-meal fruit selection was of exceptional quality. We had the best mango one can imagine (and probably 10x better!!!)\n\nIt is pricy but, less pricy than flights to Japan (you also won’t need to take leave or book hotels!) It’s like a little taste of Japan without the effort of long haul flights, truly the best you can get in London. Will for sure visit their original Ginza location soon.",

I think the chef is called Michael and you could watch him make every piece of sushi carefully one by one. While busy making fresh sushi he would top up our water and whenever we finished our fresh ginger, he would top that up too.\n\nThe menu was varied and flavours went well. Fish was fresh. The 10 days aged Balfego tuna was amazing and so was the Scottish salmon. The ebi tempura hand roll was freshly fried.\n\nWasn’t sure what the difference between the £45 time slot and £75 time slot was but was happy with the £45 set. I think the whole experience and quality was worth the money. I’m sure the £75 set is a more elevated experience.\n\nHighly recommend!

The wagyu beef and bone marrow were sublime. The presentation on the aged tuna matched the succulent flavors. The omakase plate was fresh and exciting. To eat a good meal is such a joy and this was such a meal. Would certainly recommend it and look forward to returning. Five stars all the way.",

While seated at the bar, I was attentively taken care of by the chef, transporting me to a traditional sushi bar in Kyoto. The sashimi selection is divine, offering a wide variety to pick from. The chef skillfully crafts each dish with artistic flair. The Nigiri is delightful, and the Unagi Don is just great, with the complementary of miso soup. It is simply pleasant. I have a very lovely experience and would definitely be back. Highly recommended.",

The lunch deal is reasonably priced for the quality and quantity you get, when we went it was around £30 each. We also got some sushi in addition and it was all incredibly fresh and high quality. I got the matcha crème brûlée as a separate dessert from the lunch deal and it was amazing! Not too sweet and very flavourful.\n\nThe service was great and they were very polite and friendly. Depending on how much you get this is definitely on the pricey side but I would definitely say it is worth it.",
