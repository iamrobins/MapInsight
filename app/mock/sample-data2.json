Excellent customer service from all the attentive staff!\n\nThere's also a covered terrace outside overlooking the park.\nLovely treat, and I will definitely visit again..",

It was a wonderful way to start our European vacation.  We enjoyed our first meal there so much, that we went back with some friends who live in London.

We had the dumplings and salmon starters, pork and veal meatballs for main and a cheesecake for desert. Absolutely everything was perfect and the dumplings were so good we ordered more!\n\nService was perfect, everyone was very friendly and attentive; topping up wine and water without us having to ask. They even threw in some free vodka shots at the end!\n\nVery much recommend to anyone and we’ll certainly be going back!",

Great service and atmosphere.\n\nAll 3 types of dumplings were tasty but especially the cabbage and mushroom. Chicken soup was cracking.\nVeal escalopes cooked a touch more than I would like but with a great sauce, cod was tasty and well cooked but the raw spinach served with it is not particularly exciting. The fish doesn't come with anything else, and I felt both mains could have used another little something on the plate (veg or carbs respectively).\nThe cheese pancake was wonderful and generous (other desserts looked substantial too) and reminiscent of the Topfen that appears in Austrian sweets. Good quality homely food, cooked well.\nService was high quality but not aloof and honestly in terms of atmosphere, Daquise is absolutely how a restaurant should be - filled with conversation but not crowded, classy but not austere, and homely without feeling dingy. Thank you for the lovely lunch.",

My friend felt that the cod was a bit dry and I felt that there were some tough bits to the venison but overall they were good. For desserts, we ended up getting the fruit dumplings and the pancakes and the pancakes were the best part of the meal.\n\nService: Really good, we felt that the waitress that served our table was really attentive and from what I noticed, this was a positive experience for other diners as well.\n\nAtmosphere: People looked like they were having a lot of fun there but granted the tight spaces for all of the tables does dampen it a little.",

This detracted from the overall ambiance of the place. The customer service was also lacking, with one staff member in particular making me feel unwelcome during my visit.\n\nOn a more positive note, the food was a highlight of the experience. The soups were delicious and the portions were generous. The mains were decent, and I particularly enjoyed the lovely local fruit drink that was offered.\n\nOne area that definitely needs improvement is the cleanliness of the toilets. A nice clean would go a long way in enhancing the overall experience for patrons. Despite some drawbacks, the tasty food made the visit somewhat worthwhile.",

Pork was a little dry, cabbage was very sour and salty and the potato puree was heavy with ham that was too smoked for me. I think you'll like this if you like strong punchy flavours.
